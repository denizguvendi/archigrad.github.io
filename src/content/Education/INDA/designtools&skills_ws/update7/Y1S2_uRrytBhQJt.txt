	Introduction  
The Digital Making workshop focuses on the process of translating complex ideas into visually compelling narratives through the creation of a concise 1-minute video project. Over the course of three weeks, students will engage in multimedia storytelling, utilizing tools such as Blender and After Effects.  
Participants will work through every stage of the production process, including storyboarding, compositional planning, 3D modeling, rendering, and post-production. The curriculum encourages a balance between technical proficiency and creative exploration, guiding students to articulate complex concepts effectively through visual media.

Materials Required
Computer with Blender 4.3, After Effects, Mouse, Earphones
Learning Objectives
Students will:
* Create a 1-minute professional video
* Master 3D modeling and post-production techniques
* Develop skills in Blender and After Effects
Week 1: Conceptualization and Storyboarding
The first week is about introducing students to the fundamentals, setting the groups, and the theme,build a scene and preparing the template After Effects file. There will be an introduction to Blender tutorial, following a group feedback session.
Schedule
* 1-1:30 PM: Lecture
   * Composition sketches
   * Foreground, mid, background techniques
   * Storytelling principles
   * Resolution and aspect ratio
* 1:30-3 PM: Tutorials
   * Installing addons
   * worldbuilding
* 3-4:30 PM: Storyboard Group Work
* 4:30-6 PM: Sequence Assembly
   * Soundtrack integration
   * Basic effects
Key Deliverables
* 1-minute .mp4 video
* Submission by Wednesday 11:59 PM
Key Skills
* Narrative concept development
* Compositional sketches
* Resolution and aspect ratio understanding
* 5-shot, 1-minute teaser storyboard
* Soundtrack integration
Storyboard Structure
1. Intro Shot: Blend opacity and blur
2. Close-up Shot 1
3. Close-up Shot 2
4. Mid Shot 1
5. Mid Shot 2
6. Far Away Shot
7. Closing Credits
Rendering Process
* Import compositional sketches
* Crop to 1-minute timeline
* Synchronize with soundtrack
* Render and upload .mp4
Week 2: 3D Modeling and Rendering
The second week is about preparing the scenes for the movies. 3D Modelling in Rhino, Blender, Houdini, scraping/and downloading existing models to prepare the 5 shots in Blender, followed by an introduction to rendering tutorials. The session will end with a group feedback session.
Schedule
* 1-3 PM: World Building
   * World Building (Using existing project or the previous Houdini work is allowed)
* 3-6 PM: Rendering Tutorials
   * Blender lighting and animation
   * Camera techniques
   * Rendering settings
Key Deliverables
* 1-minute .mp4 video
* Submission by Wednesday 11:59 PM
Key Skills
* Blender UI navigation
* 3D model importing and placement
* UV unwrapping
* Camera techniques
* Lighting and atmospheric effects
Shot Composition
1. Close-up Shot
   * Human-held camera
   * Depth of field
2. Mid Shot
   * Drone or handheld camera
3. Far Away Shot
Rendering Considerations
* Pre-render in OpenGL
* Check timing and animation
* Render in Cycles
* Integrate with After Effects
Week 3: Compositing and Post-Production
The third week is about wrapping up the 1-minute videos. Post-processing tutorials will follow group-by-group feedback sessions. 
Schedule
* 1-3 PM: Group Tutorials
   * Story feedback
* 3-6 PM: Group Execution
   * Post-processing
   * Sharpening
   * Frame interpolation
Key Deliverables
* 1-minute .mp4 video
* Submission by Wednesday 11:59 PM
Key Skills
* Multi-layer compositing
* Sound design
* Particle effect integration
* Color grading
* Frame interpolation
Shot Composition Revisions
1. Intro Shot: Blend opacity and blur
2. Close-up Shot 1
3. Close-up Shot 2
4. Mid Shot 1
5. Mid Shot 2
6. Far Away Shot
Post-Production Techniques
* Atmospheric layer addition
* Sound layering (wind, footsteps, drone)
* Color grading
* Vignetting
* Grain application
Rendering Time Calculation
* 1 frame = 5 minutes rendering
* 1-minute video (30 fps) = 1800 frames
* Total potential rendering time: 6.25 days
Grading Criteria
Completion: 40%
* Timely submission
* Adherence to brief instructions
* Deliverables in good condition
Evaluation Metrics: 60%
* Storyline maturity
* Compositional quality
* Technical execution
* Overall visual experience
Emphasis
The course prioritizes personal artistic expression and creative interpretation. Technical skills are important, but the focus is on innovative storytelling and visual communication.
Pro Tips
* Pre-render animations in OpenGL
* Calculate render times meticulously
* Don't underestimate post-processing complexity
* Focus on slow, deliberate camera movements
